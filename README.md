# evolution-on-canvas
Engine for evolution games on HTML5 canvas. 
The idea is that you can take this engine and create any program which involves evolution of any 2D creatures of your own design.
Presently the program is messy and my goal is to make it look nice. It will take some time.

The reason I started this project in the first place is that I want to learn how to write clean code.
I’m in the process of reading a book called ‘Clean Code’. As I read it, I try to apply the principles I learn from it to this project. 

The way I work with this project is I create a mess and then try to clean things up. So, if you see a mess, it means that I didn't have time to get rid of it yet. 

For starters, I want to create a program in which red dot chase blue dots and eat them. The looks of the dots won't change. The only thing that evolves here is their behaviour.
